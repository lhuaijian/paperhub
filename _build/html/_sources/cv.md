### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

---

**1. Optical performance monitoring for optical fiber communication system**        *2018.10-2021.04*

This topic aims to analyze the condition of the coherent optical network by estimating the parameters of signals, from which I got the following skills:

- Deep learning algorithm construction. Capable of programming deep learning algorithms independently (i.e. DNN, CNN, RNN, etc.) to predict multiple parameters.

- Solving an ill-posed problem for spectrum retrieval. Able to design the optical delays within the Mach-Zehnder array on SOI to recover the spectrum and denoise the spectrum.

**2. Power control optimization for ultra-wideband WDM system**        *2021.04-Present*

This area involves the optimization of launch power to maximize and flatten the capacity over channels, from which I got the following skills:

- Using the closed-form GN model to analyze the power evolution of ASE noise, nonlinear noise, and signal power. This is the cornerstone of network resource planning and allocation.

- Applying the optimization algorithm (the simulated annealing algorithm) to find optimal solutions efficiently.
